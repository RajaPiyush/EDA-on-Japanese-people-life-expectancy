Overview
This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on life expectancy in Japan, utilizing statistical and geographical data to uncover trends, disparities, and potential factors influencing longevity across different regions.

Data Sources
Japan_life_expectancy.csv: Contains detailed records on life expectancy, possibly including variables like age, gender, region, and health indicators.
japan.geojson: Geospatial data file defining the boundaries of administrative regions in Japan, used for mapping and spatial analysis.
Methodology
Data Cleaning: Initial processing of the CSV data to handle missing values, outliers, and data consistency issues.
Statistical Analysis: Application of descriptive statistics to understand central tendencies, dispersion, and distribution characteristics of life expectancy.
Geospatial Analysis: Integration of life expectancy data with geojson boundaries to perform spatial analysis and visualize regional variations in life expectancy.
Correlation Analysis: Examination of potential correlations between life expectancy and various demographic, health, and environmental factors.
Key Findings
Insights into regional disparities in life expectancy.
Identification of significant factors correlating with higher or lower life expectancy.
Trends over time, highlighting improvements or declines in specific areas or demographics.
Technologies Used
Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and GeoPandas for geospatial analysis.
Running the Analysis
Instructions on setting up the environment, installing necessary libraries, and executing the notebook to replicate the analysis.

### Overview

- This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on life expectancy in Japan, utilizing statistical and geographical data to uncover trends, disparities, and potential factors influencing longevity across different regions.

### Data Sources

- **Japan_life_expectancy.csv**: Contains detailed records on life expectancy, possibly including variables like age, gender, region, and health indicators.
- **japan.geojson**: Geospatial data file defining the boundaries of administrative regions in Japan, used for mapping and spatial analysis.

### Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Initial processing of the CSV data to handle missing values, outliers, and data consistency issues.
   
2. **Statistical Analysis**:
   - Application of descriptive statistics to understand central tendencies, dispersion, and distribution characteristics of life expectancy.

3. **Geospatial Analysis**:
   - Integration of life expectancy data with geojson boundaries to perform spatial analysis and visualize regional variations in life expectancy.

4. **Correlation Analysis**:
   - Examination of potential correlations between life expectancy and various demographic, health, and environmental factors.

### Key Findings

- Insights into regional disparities in life expectancy.
- Identification of significant factors correlating with higher or lower life expectancy.
- Trends over time, highlighting improvements or declines in specific areas or demographics.

### Technologies Used

- Python, with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and GeoPandas for geospatial analysis.

### Running the Analysis

- Instructions on setting up the environment, installing necessary libraries, and executing the notebook to replicate the analysis.
